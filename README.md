The program I want to make surveys the user using these images as options to select for their 
preferred style. There are 4 rounds and 4 photos for each style. in each round, the user is 
shown one image of each style. When a user selects a style there should be a counter for each
style to keep score and give the user the style that suits them the most then linking them to a 
Pinterest board for that style. 

Background info: using jupyter notebook and mac.
I have a folder that contains my projects ipynb python file in the folder “MIS_Project”
Within this folder, there is another folder called Styles which holds a folder for each style 
(“vintage”, “prep”, “minimalist”, “workwear”, “streetwear”) in each of these folders there are 
4 .jpg files I want to use for this project

Currently, im having issues with loading and displaying the images
